# AI-Powered Smart Kitchen & Waste Minimizer for Restaurants

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **AI-driven Smart Kitchen System** designed to help restaurants **reduce food waste** and **enhance profitability**. By leveraging **computer vision, machine learning, and advanced analytics**, the system automates inventory tracking, predicts food spoilage, and provides actionable insights for waste reduction.

## 🚀 Key Features
### **1. Computer Vision for Smart Inventory Management**
✅ Automatically **extracts product names and expiry dates** from food labels using **OCR**.  
✅ Identifies **food types and estimates quantity** via image recognition.  
✅ Eliminates **manual inventory entry** by automating data collection.  

### **2. AI-Powered Demand & Waste Prediction**
✅ Predicts **future ingredient consumption** based on past sales, seasonality, and events.  
✅ Forecasts **waste-prone items** using machine learning models.  
✅ Suggests **optimal inventory levels** to prevent over-purchasing.  

### **3. Intelligent Menu Optimization**
✅ Dynamically **adjusts menu prices** based on demand.  
✅ Generates **new recipes** using near-expiry ingredients.  
✅ Provides **cost optimization suggestions** for maximizing profits.  

### **4. Vision-Powered Waste Analysis & Reporting**
✅ Uses AI models to **analyze leftover food quantity** on plates.  
✅ Generates **heatmaps** to visualize high-waste areas in the kitchen.  
✅ Provides **financial insights on waste**, helping reduce costs.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### **Frontend**  
✅ React.js – User Interface for inventory, reports, and analytics.  

### **Backend**  
✅ Flask – Handles API requests, processes AI models, and manages data.  

### **Database**  
✅ MongoDB – Stores inventory, sales, waste reports, and AI-generated insights.  

### **AI/ML Models & Libraries**  
✅ **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, EasyOCR, YOLO for image processing.  
✅ **Demand Prediction:** Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).  
✅ **Waste Analysis:** Image Segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN), Heatmap Generation.  
✅ **Recipe Generation:** OpenAI, Hugging Face for AI-driven dish creation.  
✅ **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy for trend analysis.  

### **Data Sources**  
✅ **Synthetic Data:** Custom dataset generated for training AI models.  
✅ **Open Source Data:** Kaggle datasets for benchmarking and improvement.  

## 📊 Accuracy & Benchmarking
### **Inventory Tracking & OCR Models**
✅ **OCR Accuracy:** ~95% on text extraction from food labels.  
✅ **Object Detection (YOLO):** mAP ~90% for ingredient recognition.  

### **AI Demand Prediction Models**
✅ **Forecasting Accuracy:** Evaluated using **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.  
✅ **Waste Prediction Performance:** Measured using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  

### **Waste Analysis & Heatmap Models**
✅ **Waste Detection IoU Score:** ~85% for food segmentation.  
✅ **Heatmap Precision:** Evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
